🧾 Credential visibility rule
- Any task that requires GitHub, Vercel, Google, or API tokens must note whether credentials already exist here.
- If access is missing, state the exact command or user action required (“Please run `vercel login` locally”).
- This prevents last-minute surprises and keeps deployments moving.

🗂 Redundancy registry rule
- This repo has many overlapping scripts (lead analyzers, Whatsapp automations, etc.).
- Whenever you touch one, note which related files exist and whether they should be merged, retired, or synced.
- Keep these notes in PRs or inline comments so future cleanups go faster.

🎯 Offer quick fix + long-term plan
- Whenever possible, provide two paths: an immediate action (e.g., edit the bundle) and a best-practice follow-up (e.g., rebuild from source).
- Clearly label each option so the user can decide based on urgency and effort.
- This approach keeps momentum going while still pushing us toward sustainable solutions.

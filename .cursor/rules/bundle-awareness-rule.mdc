📦 Bundle-awareness rule
- Much of the live site content sits inside compiled `js/index-*.js` files.
- Before editing, confirm whether we should patch the bundle or locate the original source and rebuild.
- Be transparent about trade-offs (fast hotfix vs. proper rebuild) so expectations stay realistic.

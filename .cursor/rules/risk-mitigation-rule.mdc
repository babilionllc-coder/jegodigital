⚠️ Risk + mitigation log
- For every change, explicitly list what could go wrong (broken deploys, outdated tokens, missing dependencies, user confusion, etc.).
- Pair each risk with a prevention or escape hatch: backups, feature flags, step-by-step rollback notes, or owner notifications.
- Highlight the severity and likelihood so we can prioritize mitigations and know which items need immediate attention.
- If a risk can’t be mitigated right away, track it as tech debt with a suggested follow-up task so it never disappears.

🧭 Give context before action
- Whenever recommending a fix, briefly explain why that approach makes sense (“Because the live text comes from the compiled bundle, we’ll edit `js/index-*.js`”).
- Mention any constraints or assumptions up front so the user isn’t surprised mid-way.
- This habit keeps everyone oriented and makes the thread self-contained if we revisit it later.

🔄 Always look to optimize
- Scan the repo with a critical eye: duplicated scripts, manual copy updates, or repeated setup steps are clues that something can be automated or centralized.
- When you notice friction, propose a concrete improvement along with the expected payoff (time saved, fewer errors) and a rough effort estimate.
- If a fix is outside our current scope, log it anyway with context so we can turn it into a future task instead of forgetting it.
- Celebrate upgrades once they land—closing the loop keeps the team motivated and reinforces a culture of continuous refinement.

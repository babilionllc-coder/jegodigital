📝 Micro-summaries for clarity
- After long explanations or multi-step plans, add a one-line recap (“In short: update the bundle file, then redeploy via Vercel”).
- These mini summaries help the user retain the key idea without rereading everything.
- Use them especially when responding to complex debugging or deployment requests.

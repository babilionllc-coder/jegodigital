🧱 Structured problem solving
- Start every investigation with a quick summary of symptoms (what users see or logs report) and where it occurs.
- Document the suspected or confirmed root cause, even if it’s “unknown,” so we can update it later once identified.
- Provide an immediate remedy (patch, rollback, toggle) plus a safer long-term fix if they differ.
- Capture optional enhancements, monitoring ideas, or refactors that would prevent recurrence.
- List dependencies, missing credentials, or approvals so we know exactly what’s blocking progress.

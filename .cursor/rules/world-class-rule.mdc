 Maintain world-class quality every time
- Treat every edit like it’s shipping to thousands of paying customers—proofread, lint, and sanity-check before you move on.
- If a task feels rushed, pause and add a TODO rather than submitting half-finished work; transparency beats silent shortcuts.
- When touching user-facing copy or automations, verify both the content and the surrounding context (fonts, icons, analytics) still make sense.
- Encourage peer review or self-review checklists when possible; quality is a habit, not a once-in-a-while event.

📝 Explain what changed and why
- Every summary should include the concrete change (files edited, endpoints touched) AND the business/user reason behind it.
- Use short examples when helpful so stakeholders can quickly connect the update to the outcome.
- Mention any related tickets, audits, or user feedback that triggered the change for easy traceability.
- If the reason is unknown, note “Reason TBD” and follow up—no change should remain undocumented.
